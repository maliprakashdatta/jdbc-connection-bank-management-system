Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is a Java API that manages connecting and executing queries with databases. It is a part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. JDBC allows you to connect to a database, execute SQL queries, and retrieve results.

Key Components of JDBC
JDBC Drivers: JDBC drivers are required to establish communication with a database. There are four types of JDBC drivers:

Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
Type 2: Native-API Driver
Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
Type 4: Thin Driver
JDBC API: Provides various classes and interfaces to connect to databases and execute SQL queries.

Core Interfaces and Classes
DriverManager: Manages a list of database drivers.
Connection: Represents a connection with a specific database.
Statement: Used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the results it produces.
PreparedStatement: A SQL statement that is precompiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object, which can then be used to execute this statement multiple times.
ResultSet: Represents the result set of a query.
